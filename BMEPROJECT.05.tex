\section{ 
 \textbf{\large What is the Meaning behind the Disruptive  innovation, in Health care } }

\begin{flushleft}


Innovation is no stranger to the healthcare sector.  Disruptive innovations are those that cause radical change and often result in new leaders in the field. They overturn the usual way of doing things to such an extent that they have a ripple effect throughout the industry.

Disruption typically involves new market entrants creating products that bring in new consumers. But in healthcare, everyone is already a consumer. In healthcare, disruption often shifts care from hospitals to clinics and office settings, and even into patients' homes. Telemedicine is the most obvious example.

Our network of connected devices, combined with the internet and the cloud, allows for an astronomical exchange of data to take place :- EHRs, Remote Care ,3D Printing ,Retail Clinics ,Augmented Reality ,Precision Medicine.

\textsc{\large AI and machine learning }	    \\
[0.35cm]
AI applications can manage patient intake and scheduling as well as billing. Chatbots answer patient questions. With natural language processing capabilities, AI can collate and analyze survey responses. AI will probably increase in use as a way to bring down healthcare costs and let doctors and staff focus on patient care.\\

\textsc{\large Blockchain            }	    \\
[0.35cm]

Blockchain is a database technology that uses encryption and other security measures to store data and link it in a way that enhances security and usability. This innovation facilitates many aspects of healthcare, including patient records, supply and distribution, and research. Tech startups have entered the healthcare sector with blockchain applications that have changed how providers use medical data. \\

\textsc{\large Telemedicine       }	    \\
[0.35cm]

COVID-19 has undoubtedly accelerated the delivery of telemedicine, and experts affirm that telemedicine is here to stay. Itâ€™s effective, doctors will be reimbursed for a telehealth consultation, and many patients prefer it.\\

      \textsc{\large Consumer devices, wearables and apps }	    \\
[0.35cm]
In the past, patients could only get biometric data when they went to the doctor's office. Now health data gathered from smartwatches and mobile fitness trackers allow consumers to play a new role in their health journey.

\section{
\textbf{\large Conclusion}}

\textsf{\large Innovation is no stranger to the healthcare sector. New therapies, medical devices, and healthcare management practices are adopted all the time. However, up until fairly recently, examples of disruptive innovations in healthcare were far less common. What is disruptive innovation, and what impact do these disruptions have on the healthcare industry? Disruptive innovations are those that cause radical change and often result in new leaders in the field. They overturn the usual way of doing things to such an extent that they have a ripple effect throughout the industry.}
